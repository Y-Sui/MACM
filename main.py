    Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. Each step, you are only allowed to choose two of the remaining numbers to obtain a new number.
    
Rules of the 24 Game
Use each of the four numbers exactly once
Use only basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (ร), and division (รท)
The final result must equal 24
Parentheses can be used to change the order of operations
